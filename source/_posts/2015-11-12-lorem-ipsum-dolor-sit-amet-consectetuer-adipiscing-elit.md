What is Responsive Design?
Using Responsive design is means creating a website that allows users the easiest and most enjoyable possible experience. This applies if the user is accessing the website from a tablet, a computer or anything else. In the early 2000s, the first responsive design website were created. This created a scuffle in the computer world because Internet Explorer was able to support the website, but Netscape wasn’t. (Netscape was a rival search engine to internet explorer in the 1990s). 

Why responsive Design? What are best practices?
Responsive design is becoming more and more important. This is because adaptations for new devices have become frequent and mobile devices now account more than half of the devices which access internet. In responsive design, the elements of the web page readjust based on the proportions of the devices screen, instead of static lengths/widths. For example, a very long web page on desktop could be a single page on an iPhone. There’s speculations to whether templates for responsive design should be created as web pages made for mobile devices first or as web pages for computers and then formatted for the other later. In order for responsive design to fully work, all the elements shown on one device’s page must fit on another device page. Using responsive design can be a very painstaking process. Designers need to account for elements of a page to fit all screens. Responsive Web Designs offers many advantages over developing specific sites for different devices. One of the main benefits is the cost! Using the same code for all devices, instead of individually coding many different sites, makes production much cheaper. Also, updates require you only to edit one set of code. Unfortunately, the other side is that if you have a problem with your website, you have a problem for all your devices.
