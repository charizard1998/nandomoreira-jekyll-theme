When reading these articles and researching what it meant to “think like a programmer”, I didn’t come across anything that particularly stood out to me. Like most things, thinking like a programmer just involves positive tendencies and logical beliefs. 
To go into a little more depth, the first article, “Effective Learning Strategies for Programmers” by Allison Kaptur, talks a lot about the idea of a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. Throughout the article Kaptur identifies the “growth mindset” as the more compatible mindset to adapt when learning programming. Kaptur communicates sociologist Carol Dweck’s research on the topic who describes her experiments. Something that was interesting about the results of her experiments was how significantly the wording of instructor’s praise effected the students’ success rates. It is interesting how much a person who isn’t savvy to the idea of growth mindsets can be effected by a teacher.
In the second article, “Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives” by Maria Popova, many of the same ideas that where conveyed in the first article were repeated. I thought the picture / graph helped me understand the theory better.	
In a third article I found well further researching what it meant to think like a programmer (How Your Beliefs Can Sabotage Your Behavior (And What You Can Do About It) By James Clear, I found out that even the thoughts you have in your mind can hold you back. What is encouraging about this, is that you can “reframe” your thoughts to emulate more positive ones which will lead to success. 
Overall, I thought the research that I did was interesting but not mind boggling. Everything that I read about, a part of me already knew. It’s logical to tell yourself that you are able to improve at things you aren’t good at. I think these findings not only apply to programming but also to life outside of the classroom.
