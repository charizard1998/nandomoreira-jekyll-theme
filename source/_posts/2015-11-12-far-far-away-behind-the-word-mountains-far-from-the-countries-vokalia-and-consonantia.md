Blog Post 2

What are Block, inline-block & inline and when should you use them?

Block:
Block is a clump of code that is condensed together. They are made up of one or more statements. The ideology of Block coding was developed in the 1950s. You know where a block begins when the keyword “begin” is entered. The block ends when the keyword “end” is entered. Block can be used to customize the code that you use in a blog post, sidebar, footer or page.  

Inline Block:
Inline block is a grid of boxes that formats your web page. Inline block can be achieved by “float”ing  and using different divs to separate the sections of code. Using inline block can be helpful when you are trying to organize your information.  Inline block elements are unique from inline elements because they can also have a length and a width. Its important to realize that when you are using inline block, it takes the page’s white space into account. Inline block formatting is also vertically aligned. This means if you toss two paragraphs into inline block, they will display on top of one another as suppose to side by side.

Inline:
This is the source code which can be found inside the program. You need to use inline when you use other coding languages to reference the program you are working on. I like to think of it as a tool to help communicate between different sectors of your code. With the simple click of a button, CSS can be painlessly embedded. Inline allows CSS properties on a “per tag” basis. You can use this to change font size and font color.

Conclusion:
Overall, I found this topic very interesting. Block, Inline and Inline Block are all closely related in terms of being CSS properties.
